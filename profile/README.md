### 🚀 Our Purpose

At **CraftedCodeNest**, we are rethinking what tools can do.

We build tools that are:

✨ **Smart by default** – AI-enhanced, context-aware, and automated  
🛡️ **Secure by design** – Hardened against vulnerabilities, made for modern devs  
⚙️ **Modular & elegant** – Beautiful CLI/GUI hybrids that just work  
🌍 **Open for all** – Inclusive, documented, and community-powered

### 🔥 Signature Projects (Launching Soon)

| 🚧 Tool | 🧩 What It Does |
|--------|----------------|
| 🛰️ **PortHawk** | AI-enhanced port scanner with CVE checks, Shodan integration, and evasion logic. |
| 🧠 **ZeroDayRadar** | Zero-day anomaly detector using behavior profiling and ML fingerprinting. |
| 🔗 **ToolForgeCLI** | Swiss-knife CLI: kill ports, host servers, harden configs, run diagnostics. |
| 🚨 **AutoSecure-CI** | CI/CD enforcer for GitHub, GitLab & Jenkins to auto-check policy and secrets. |
| 🐞 **BugHawkAI** | Scan logs, predict bugs, suggest patches. Powered by LLMs + static analysis. |
